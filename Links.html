                            This part of the list contains the most useful links/tools I’ve found. <br> <br>


<a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">Ublock Origin</a>
 - Free ad blocker, available on most browsers (although you should switch to Firefox if you haven’t already) Honestly without this, browsing the internet is absolutely insufferable.<br> <br>

<a href="https://fmhy.net/">FMHY</a> - A huge list of free software, websites, and services for literally anything you could think of.<br> <br>

<a href="https://sponsor.ajay.app/">Sponsor Skip</a>  - Skips youtube sponsors, if you don’t use a youtube frontend with this installed already, I highly recommend it. <br> <br>

<a href="https://marginalia-search.com/">Marginalia Search</a>  - Search engine for personal blogs, I’ve found a lot of really interesting and charming websites through this.<br> <br>

<a href="https://archive.is/">Archive Today</a>  – News from reputable sources is hard to come by, and its a shame so much of it is locked behind a paywall, this extension allows you to view full articles that have been archived. Works on most news sites with paywalls.<br> <br>


<a href="https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html">Lightshot</a> – simple screenshoting tool for win and mac. <br> <br>
